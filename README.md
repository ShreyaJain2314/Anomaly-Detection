# Anomaly-Detection

Anomaly detection using Isolation Forest on the provided data involved the following steps:

Data Preprocessing: The dataset containing information such as usernames, IP addresses, dates, and timestamps was preprocessed to ensure uniformity and consistency. This involved tasks such as data cleaning, formatting, and conversion of categorical variables into numerical representations if necessary.

Feature Engineering: Relevant features were extracted from the dataset to be used for anomaly detection. In this case, the IP addresses, dates, and timestamps were important features for identifying anomalies in network traffic.

Isolation Forest Model Training: The Isolation Forest algorithm was applied to the preprocessed dataset. Isolation Forest is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm specifically designed for anomaly detection. It works by isolating anomalies in the data by randomly selecting a feature and then randomly selecting a split value between the maximum and minimum values of the selected feature. This process is repeated recursively to build an ensemble of isolation trees.

Anomaly Detection: Once the Isolation Forest model was trained, it was used to detect anomalies in the data. Anomalies were identified as instances that had a low path length in the isolation trees, indicating that they were isolated from the rest of the data points and hence, likely to be anomalies.

Evaluation: The performance of the Isolation Forest model was evaluated using appropriate metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and/or ROC-AUC score depending on the nature of the anomaly detection task.

Visualization: Results of the anomaly detection process were visualized to gain insights into the detected anomalies and their characteristics. This could involve plotting anomalies against normal data points or visualizing the isolation trees to understand the separation of anomalies from normal instances.

Overall, Isolation Forest proved to be effective in detecting anomalies in the network traffic data, providing valuable insights for cybersecurity and network monitoring purposes.
